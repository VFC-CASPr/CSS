# Civic Security Stack

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-02 at 10.38.25 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>CSS Logo</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Purpose

To provide a modular and actionable framework for state and local governments to deploy, govern, and sustain cybersecurity policy functions using the Civic Security Stack model.

### 1. Stack Overview

#### 1.1 Objective

The **Civic Security Stack** is a structured, modular policy framework designed to enable government entities to deploy cybersecurity in the public interest with precision, interoperability, and sustainability. Inspired by the architecture of traditional technology solution stacks (e.g., LAMP, WAMP, ELK, etc), this stack defines layered functions that build upon each other to deliver secure, resilient, and equitable digital public services.

It replaces ad hoc, siloed approaches to cybersecurity governance with a composable architecture that aligns policy, operations, and infrastructure into a coherent system—treating cybersecurity not as a compliance burden, but as civic infrastructure.

The Civic Security Stack exists to:

* **Operationalize public interest cybersecurity** by anchoring it in functional layers that correspond to actual government responsibilities.
* **Enable replicability** by giving jurisdictions a shared language and framework, allowing adaptation without reinvention.
* **Establish clear roles and responsibilities** across government units, vendors, community stakeholders, and civil society.
* **Facilitate strategic planning and measurement** of cybersecurity initiatives across maturity levels and political contexts.
* **Support cross-jurisdictional coordination** by acting as a connective tissue between federal, state, and local efforts.
* **Integrate cybersecurity with democratic accountability** by tying security outcomes to public trust, transparency, and inclusion.

#### 1.2 Stack Layers

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-06-02 at 10.47.30 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Visualization of the Civic Stack Layers.</p></figcaption></figure>

Each layer corresponds to a distinct function. Together, they form a complete deployment profile.

| Layer              | Function                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application**    | Deliver outcomes that citizens see and trust (resilience, transparency, continuity) |
| **Policy**         | Define enforceable norms, mandates, and strategic priorities                        |
| **Coordination**   | Enable interagency, inter-jurisdictional, and public-private collaboration          |
| **Execution**      | Implement operational cybersecurity actions and playbooks                           |
| **Infrastructure** | Secure foundational systems delivering public services                              |

Each layer is both **independent** and **interdependent**. A weakness in one layer compromises others. Strength across all layers reinforces civic resilience.

| Layer              | Function                                               | Example Artifacts                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application**    | Deliver civic outcomes (trust, continuity, resilience) | Public dashboards, disclosure portals, threat transparency sites            |
| **Policy**         | Codify intent into enforceable rules                   | State statutes, executive orders, grant language, model ordinances          |
| **Coordination**   | Enable multi-actor alignment and response              | MOU templates, task force charters, information-sharing protocols           |
| **Execution**      | Operationalize plans and responses                     | Incident response SOPs, tabletop injects, patch SLAs                        |
| **Infrastructure** | Secure foundational mission systems                    | Config hardening guides, asset inventory templates, cyber hygiene playbooks |

#### **Stack Rationale (Why “Stack” Works)**

* Conveys composability and interdependence
* Implies extensibility (e.g., layers can be added, upgraded, deprecated)
* Allows policy abstraction for mixed audiences (technical, managerial, civic, etc.)
* Enables easy mapping of responsibilities across normally nebulous layers of cybersecurity strategy

### 2. Stack Deployment Model

#### 2.1 Minimum Viable Deployment

* At least one operational artifact per layer
* Designated Stack Steward for each layer
* Defined coordination interface (vertical or horizontal)

#### 2.2 Deployment Profiles

**Small Municipality Profile**

* Application: Static breach notification web page
* Policy: Acceptable Use Policy (template)
* Coordination: Quarterly contact with regional ISAC or fusion center
* Execution: One local tabletop/year
* Infrastructure: MFA deployed for all election systems

**State-Level Profile**

* Application: Cyber readiness dashboard
* Policy: Statewide cybersecurity minimum standards for localities
* Coordination: Whole-of-state cyber working group charter
* Execution: Tiered IR playbook with support escalation
* Infrastructure: OT security assessment schedule

***

### 3. Governance Structure

#### 3.1 Stack Stewardship

Each layer must be owned and maintained by a clearly designated steward.

| Layer          | Steward                     | Example Title                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Application    | Civic Engagement/Comms Lead | State CIO, Public Affairs Officer           |
| Policy         | Legal or Compliance Officer | General Counsel, CISO                       |
| Coordination   | Intergov Liaison            | Fusion Center Manager, Regional Planner     |
| Execution      | Operations Chief            | IR Lead, Security Operations Center Manager |
| Infrastructure | Technical Admin             | Systems Architect, IT Director              |

#### 3.2 StackOps Working Group

A multidisciplinary internal governance team responsible for:

* Quarterly reviews
* Artifact updates
* Stack maturity audits

***

### 4. Policy Integration and Interoperability

#### 4.1 Integration Targets

* **State/National Cyber Strategy Pillars**: Map layers to deterrence, resilience, public-private partnership
* **FEMA/CISA Guidance**: Embed layers in Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) and/or align with Community Lifeline Sectors
* **Fusion Center Ops**: Leverage stack to operationalize intelligence and IR protocols

#### 4.2 Version Control

Establish versioning protocol for stack deployments:

* v0.1 = Pilot (2+ layers)
* v1.0 = Full deployment
* v1.1+ = Integrated with grants, audits, state dashboards

***

### 5. Metrics and Sustainment

#### 5.1 Health Indicators per Layer

| Layer          | Indicator                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Application    | % of uptime for public cyber disclosures             |
| Policy         | Number of localities using model standards           |
| Coordination   | # of regional engagements/year                       |
| Execution      | MTTD/MTTR improvements                               |
| Infrastructure | % of systems with asset inventory and secure configs |

#### 5.2 Sustainment Plan

* Annual full-stack audit
* 18-month artifact refresh cycle
* Monthly StackOps coordination
* One whole-stack exercise annually

### **6. Benefits of using the Civic Security Stack**

**1. Clarity and Modularity**

The stack enables architectural discipline on government cybersecurity work and reduces the time government entities spend on efforts with low ROI. It enables a process to more clearly define roles and responsibilities in a way that mirrors how systems actually function. No more treating policy, operations, and communications as separable responsibilities. Rather, they are not interoperable parts of a larger cohesive system.&#x20;

**2. Adaptability and Scalability**

Whether you're a rural county with 1 IT generalist or a state with 3,000 employees in cyber-specific roles, the stack adapts. Each layer can be customized or deployed incrementally, allowing for maturity without prerequisite scale.

**3. Tangible Deliverables**

Each layer demands real, deployable artifacts like SOPs, dashboards, portals, model policies, or MOUs. These aren't concepts, but rather component parts of the system. Eventually governments can build, deploy, and version them like any other code library, not just internally but globally across governments and industries as well.&#x20;

**4. Interoperability**

The stack purposefully aligns with national initiatives (e.g., National Cyber Strategy, BEAD, SLTT CPGs, FEMA’s cyber guidance) and institutional roles (e.g., MS-ISAC, fusion centers, mutual aid compacts).

**5. Measurability**

Each layer can be assessed independently with clear metrics to improve funding accountability, grant reporting, and continuous improvement cycles. It enables benchmarking and prioritization based on actual system dependencies, no longer just political urgency.

**6. Democratization of Cybersecurity**

By framing cybersecurity as layered civic infrastructure, the stack opens the field to non-technical personnel who are actively engaged in the security space like policy staff, legal teams, elected officials, and the public. It embeds the community into cyber planning.

**7. Readiness for Real-World Threats**

The stack enables resilience not just through detection and response but by ensuring upstream systems, such as coordination, law, governance, etc. are in place. It hardens not just devices, but institutions.

***

The Civic Security Stack is not a report or a pilot. It is instead an operating system for public sector cybersecurity governance. It treats each government responsibility or capability like a node in a larger system, capable of running the same architecture, even if the scale, tooling, and resources differ.

It turns cybersecurity into **civic code**—buildable, debuggable, extensible.
